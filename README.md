# virtualdevicesdecor
Create virtual devices with icons and decorative and beautiful tiles, with aesthetics and design in mind. A fan with fan icon and tile, a window with icon and window controls and much more.

They are virtual devices for Smartthings on most Switches, but all with standard icons and tiles. Example: If you create a Virtual Switch to use in the Ventilator it always comes in the format of on and off, with these devices you can leave your virtual device with the icon of the fan, the light, the sensor. Everything thought about aesthetics. The sensors only really work as sensors if they are added to the IFTTT, and can be used later to activate it via IFTTT and The Home Remote. And he must not leave the IFTTT.
